Cosmolost is a demo for a WebGL game engine I wrote for my Computer Graphics class in the spring of 2023.

I had a lot of fun and learned a ton working on this, but I'm done with it. If you can get anything out of this source code, that's awesome. Feel free to use this any way you see fit.
A good bit of the demo-centric code is pretty messy from crunching for my final project, but the core engine code is more solid.
